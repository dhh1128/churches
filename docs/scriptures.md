    <td>the disciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about.</td>
    <td><p>With a modern, global mindset, we tend to think of "church" as a global thing. However, in <cite>The Book of Mormon</cite>, although there are usages of "church" that clearly have this meaning (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.3?lang=eng#p2">Alma 1:3</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.4-6?lang=eng#p3">Alma 4:4-6</a>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.24-26?lang=eng#p23">Hel 3:24-26</a> for example), churches were clearly experienced mostly as a local phenomenon. There wasn't an easy way to stitch together the local units into something larger. Thus we see Alma in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.1-8?lang=eng">Alma 6</a>, doing things for the church at Zarahemla, and then for the church in the land of Gideon. The same is true in the New Testament, where John wrote to "the seven churches in Asia" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/1.11?lang=eng#p10">Rev 1:11</a>), and the writer of Acts speaks of "the church at Antioch" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/13.1?lang=eng">Acts 13:1</a>).</p>
    <p>A possible point to ponder: When we say "the church is true", how would we feel differently if we meant "the ward or stake I live in is true"? And when Nephi condemns churches for worldliness, priestcraft, and pride, could that apply or not apply in different degrees, depending on which local congregation we're talking about?</p>

    <td>
    <p>20 And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.</p>
    <p>21 And there are many churches built up which cause envyings, and strifes, and malice.</p>
    <p>29 He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</p>
    </td>
    <td><p>Here, Nephi is talking about churches that specifically exhibit the trait of priestcraft, which he defines as men setting themselves up as priests, leading with their own wisdom, seeking praise and money. If the men are priests, what is their god? The money and praise are; this is the idol they worship. The word "stumblingblock" is cross-referenced in our edition of <cite>The Book of Mormon</cite> to <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/14.3-7?lang=eng#p2">Ezek 14:3-7</a>. Ezekiel was a contemporary of Nephi (began prophesying between 597 and 590 BC), and the two may even have known each other. He remained in Jerusalem through the destruction that Nephi escaped. He said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>3 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?</p>
    <p>4 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;</p>
    <p>5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</p>
    <p>6 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</p>
    <p>7 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the Lord will answer him by myself:</p>

<td><p>28 Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be denied, and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride of their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and teachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches.</p>
<p>32 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say: Come unto me, and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins.</p>
<p>33 O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation upon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God; for behold, the time cometh at that day when all these things must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>36 And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.</p>
<p>37 For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.</p>
<p>38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies—because of the praise of the world?</p>
<p>40 Yea, why do ye build up your secret abominations to get gain, and cause that widows should mourn before the Lord, and also orphans to mourn before the Lord, and also the blood of their fathers and their husbands to cry unto the Lord from the ground, for vengeance upon your heads?</p>
</td>
<td><p>Intriguing that "churches become defiled." To defile something, <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/defile">it must first be pure or holy</a>.</p>
<p>Also interesting that churches will "be lifted up in the pride of their hearts." Normally I would think this is possible for individuals, not for churches. Certainly, Moroni can't be talking here about physical buildings, but about the nature of the motives and attitudes of an abstract institution. Very next sentence talks about leaders being proud and envying. My first read of this was that they envy each other for the members they have -- but actually, what this says is that the leaders are characterized by "envying of them that belong". Does this mean they envy the members, or envy other churches because of their members? To me, leaders who envy those who belong sounds like corrupt politicians who look at polling data and try to manipulate voters. It may also refer to televangelists and media figures in general (counting Twitter followers) and the rise of tribes.
</p>
<p>Note reference to churches "built up to get gain" is followed in verse 40 by "secret abominations built up to get gain". Does this equate churches that have this characteristic with secret abominations? That might make churches like drug cartels, for example.</p>
<p>The phrase "holy church of God" feels to me like it is in a different conceptual category from the churches Moroni highlights elsewhere. It may refer to the woman who went into the wilderness (Rev 12), which consists of all those who follow Jesus sincerely, no matter what institutions they belong to.</p>
<p>Note that teachers, not just church leaders, are condemned for pride and envy in verse 28. This makes the mapping to educational institutions more resonant.</p>
<p>I think the phrase "get gain" in verse 33 is more than simply "make a financial profit." It may have a meaning closer to the modern English phrase "get ahead," which touches on wealth but emphasizes competitiveness and self-aggrandizement. Look at Hel 7:21: "But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver." The first expansion of the phrase is about personal pride; wealth is added as a secondary consideration in Nephi's critique.</p>

<p>4 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the Gentiles the formation of a great church.</p>
<p>5 And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation of a church which is most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into captivity.</p>
<p>6 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.</p>
<p>7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and fine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw many harlots.</p>
<p>8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine-twined linen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this great and abominable church.</p>
<p>26 And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the formation of that great and abominable church, which is most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away.</p>
<p>28 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and precious things taken away from the book, which is the book of the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>32 Neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall forever remain in that awful state of blindness, which thou beholdest they are in, because of the plain and most precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen.</p>
<p>34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the remnant of the house of Israel—and this remnant of whom I speak is the seed of thy father—wherefore, after I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb.</p>

This church is introduced as a "great church", and thereafter it is consistently characterized by Nephi as either "great and abominable" or just "abominable". I wonder if this is, for him, an entirely different category of organization from ordinary churches. Its greatness may refer to its aggregate and global nature. The word "abominable" surely resonates to Joseph Smith's report that the Lord said the creeds of modern Christian sects were an "abomination" in His sight (JSH 1:19).
