<td>And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me.</td>
<td>The concept of a "church" was applied by Nephi to a religious association among the Jews. Not all Jews belonged to it, apparently.</td>

<p>4 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the Gentiles the formation of a great church.</p>
<p>5 And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation of a church which is most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into captivity.</p>
<p>6 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.</p>
<p>7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and fine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw many harlots.</p>
<p>8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine-twined linen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this great and abominable church.</p>
<p>26 And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the formation of that great and abominable church, which is most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away.</p>
<p>28 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and precious things taken away from the book, which is the book of the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>32 Neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall forever remain in that awful state of blindness, which thou beholdest they are in, because of the plain and most precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen.</p>
<p>34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the remnant of the house of Israel—and this remnant of whom I speak is the seed of thy father—wherefore, after I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb.</p>

This church is introduced as a "great church", and thereafter it is consistently characterized by Nephi as either "great and abominable" or just "abominable". I wonder if this is, for him, an entirely different category of organization from ordinary churches. Its greatness may refer to its aggregate and global nature. The word "abominable" surely resonates to Joseph Smith's report that the Lord said the creeds of modern Christian sects were an "abomination" in His sight (JSH 1:19).

The Greek account has him using a word that is translated as "church" to describe the assembly of Israel, perhaps -- or perhaps the physical environment of the holy mount Sina.</td>

<td>Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. Likewise greet the church that is in their house.</td>
<td>Paul. "Churches of the Gentiles" refers to assemblies of believers in gentile lands. The "church that is in their house" refers to a specific assembly in a specific location.</td>
